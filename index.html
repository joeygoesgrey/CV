<h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
<p> I am a teen who loves to learn new things and add value to myself.
In the future i want to be a cybersecurity expert majoring in 
networks and social engineering
(i do read alot of book regarding the human psychology).
Notwithstanding, I also want to learn about other fields regarding cybersecurity
such as API hacking, web applications, mobile applications hacking etc. 
However, I wanna start off as a programmer..... 
I know but it is a little decision of mine ðŸ˜Š
because i think it is necessary you fit yourself into the minds
of the programmer and think like a hacker in order to penetrate
complex and hardened systems. -just my opinion-
